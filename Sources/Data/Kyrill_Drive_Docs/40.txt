The autocratic management style is known for being strict and controlling.This style gives clarity on structure and roles and everyone knows where he belongs. The bad part about it is that it may create a bad vibe for some employees since this style is more harsh than others.
Another style is the empowering management style, which can give employees more responsibility which often leads to more productivity and fulfillment for the employees. The other side would be that the employee may be overwhelmed since he doesn’t get just direct tasks all the time.
Laissez-faire is a style as the name already says, that is lazy. So the hierarchy may blur, which may be a problem. It may also lead to employees being happy too.
