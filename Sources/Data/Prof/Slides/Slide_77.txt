The slide seems to be discussing the evolution of question and answer (Q&A) systems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically the transition from extractive to abstractive Q&A methodologies.

On the left side of the slide, there's a flowchart describing an extractive Q&A system. In an extractive system, a question is input into an Information Retrieval System, which then consults an External Knowledge database to find related contexts. For example, dense vectors or BM25, which is a common text retrieval algorithm, may be used to search through the external knowledge and retrieve relevant information. The retriever outputs ranked contexts, then a Reader component selects a context and identifies the answer within that context, usually by marking a start and end point within the text.

On the right side, the slide describes an abstractive Q&A system with a different flowchart. Here, the same initial steps are followed, with a question being put through an Information Retrieval System to find related contexts, which are then ranked. However, instead of just selecting and extracting the answer from the context, an abstractive system uses a Generator component, which integrates Language Model (LM) capabilities such as BERT or GPT (models designed to understand and generate human-like text) to synthesize or paraphrase the information in the form of an answer. This process is characterized as Text Generation, as the system is not just pulling text directly from the source material, but generating new text that captures the meaning of the answer.

At the top right of the slide, there is a chat bubble with text that appears to be discussing subscription fees for ChatGPT Plus. It notes that OpenAI has launched a premium app version of ChatGPT that includes fees. There is an extractive answer provided detailing the price for an extractive answer ($20), and an abstractive one mentioning that in addition to this fee, there may be other benefits for a subscription fee for ChatGPT Plus.

The overall message of this slide is to show the progression of Q&A systems from simply extracting answers directly from texts (extractive) to being able to synthesize and create new text that conveys the same information (abstractive), which can provide more nuanced and potentially less verbatim answers.
