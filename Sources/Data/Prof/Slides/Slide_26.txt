The slide is detailing how BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained language model, can be fine-tuned for various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The slide consists of four diagrams, each representing a different type of task for which BERT can be adapted:

(a) Sentence Pair Classification Tasks:
The diagram illustrates how BERT can be utilized for tasks that involve classifying relationships between a pair of sentences. The class label is predicted based on the representation of the [CLS] token, which combines information from both sentences. Examples of such tasks include MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference), QQP (Quora Question Pairs), QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference), STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark), MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus), RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment), and SWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations).

(b) Single Sentence Classification Tasks:
This diagram shows how BERT can be used to classify a single sentence into a category, again using the [CLS] token's representation as the basis for prediction. Examples of tasks include SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank, version 2) and CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability).

(c) Question Answering Tasks:
In this case, BERT is fine-tuned to answer questions based on a given paragraph. The model predicts the start and end spans of the answer within the passage. An example task given is SQuAD v1.1 (Stanford Question Answering Dataset, version 1.1).

(d) Single Sentence Tagging Tasks:
BERT can also be adapted for token-level tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). The diagram shows a token-level prediction where each token in a single sentence is tagged based on its role in the context of the sentence. The example dataset mentioned is CoNLL-2003 NER.

In all diagrams, the structure of BERT is represented with the input layer consisting of different word tokens (T1, T2, ..., Tn), the embedding layers (E), and a final layer that translates BERT's contextual understanding into specific tasks (e.g., classification, tagging). The use of [CLS] and [SEP] tokens is per BERT's input convention, where [CLS] is a special token used for classification tasks, and [SEP] is used to separate segments (e.g., two sentences in pair classification or a question and paragraph in question answering tasks).
