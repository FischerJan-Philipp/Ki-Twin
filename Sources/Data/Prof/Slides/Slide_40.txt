This slide presents a concept within the field of neural networks, specifically focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with multiple layers. The graphic on the slide depicts two layers of RNNs stacked on top of each other.

- **Layer 1**: This is the first layer of the RNN, often referred to as the "input layer" in this context. The graphical representation shows a series of interconnected nodes, each labeled with 'h' and a superscript that changes over time (t-2, t-1, t, t+1, t+2). These nodes represent the hidden states of the RNN at different time steps. The arrows between the nodes indicate connections that transfer information from one time step to the next. The 'W' near the arrows denotes the weights that modulate the connections within the RNN layer.

- **Layer 2**: This is the second or upper layer of the RNN, often referred to as a "hidden layer" or "higher layer." It takes the output sequence of Layer 1 as its input. Similar to the first layer, it also consists of interconnected nodes, with the notation 'h' followed by a superscript denoting the sequence of hidden states. Similarly, this layer processes information over time.

The key point indicated by the arrows in the middle of the diagram is that the output sequence of Layer 1 serves as the input for Layer 2. This means the hidden states (the 'h' values) calculated in Layer 1 are used as the input values for Layer 2. This arrangement allows for the construction of deeper RNN models capable of learning more complex patterns in the data.

The 'U' letter found in the bottom connections might represent the weights for input-to-hidden layer connections although not explicitly explained in this slide.

RNNs are particularly useful for processing sequential data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition, due to their capability to maintain memory of previous inputs through their connections. By stacking RNNs, as illustrated, the network can potentially capture more abstract representations of the data or understand context at different levels of abstraction. 

However, the specifics of the architecture, such as how weights are updated or how data flows between layers beyond this, are not detailed in the slide and would generally require more information on the particular RNN implementation being used.
