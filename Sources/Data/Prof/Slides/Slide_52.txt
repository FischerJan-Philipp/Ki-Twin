I'm sorry, but the specific textual content of the slide you've provided is mostly obscured and cannot be read. The visible portion of the slide suggests that it might relate to an agreement concerning the European Economic Area (EEA) and includes a reference to the date "August 1992," which might be related to an event, signature, or implementation of such an agreement. The slide's title, "Information Is Often In Different Order," could imply that the lecture is discussing information processing, organization of content, or challenges in understanding information that is not sequentially or logically ordered. However, without more visible text, a detailed explanation of the information is not possible.
