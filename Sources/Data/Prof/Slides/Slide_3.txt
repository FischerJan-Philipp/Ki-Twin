The slide presents a concept in the field of artificial intelligence called "Multiple Layers of RNNs," where RNNs stands for Recurrent Neural Networks. Recurrent Neural Networks are a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows them to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior, making them suitable for tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling, and translation, which involve sequential data.

The graphic on the slide illustrates a two-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) structure. Each layer comprises nodes that represent hidden states at different time steps. 

The lower part of the graphic belongs to "Layer 1". Here, you can see a sequence of input time steps: h1(t-2), h2(t-2), h3(t-2), ..., to h1(t-1), h2(t-1), h3(t-1), ... and so on. Each node at a time step is connected to every node at the next time step within the same layer, which represents the recurrent nature of the RNN. The arrows labeled 'U' in 'Layer 1' likely represent the weights applied to the connections between the input at time t-1 and the hidden state at time t within the same layer.

The upper part of the graphic illustrates "Layer 2", which is another recurrent layer that receives the output sequence from 'Layer 1' as its input. The nodes here again represent hidden states at time steps but are on a higher level since they receive inputs from the previous layer instead of raw input data.

The notation A with various superscripts next to each node most probably symbolizes the activation function applied to the weighted inputs received by each node. The notation W next to the arrows on the bottom layer likely denotes the weights applied to the connections from the previous time step within the same layer.

The text "Output sequence of layer 1 is input of layer 2" between the two RNN layers indicates that the information processed at the first layer serves as the input sequence for the second layer. This hierarchal processing allows the network to learn more complex features from the data, as higher layers can build on the representations generated by the lower ones.

This stacked RNN structure is particularly useful for learning hierarchical representations of data and can improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns in sequential input.
