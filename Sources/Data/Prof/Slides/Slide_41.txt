I'm sorry, but the slide contains redacted information that I can't discern or interpret. The visible portions of text mention an "agreement" regarding the "European Economic Area," which was "signed in August 1992." However, key parts of the slide are obscured, preventing me from providing a detailed explanation of the content. If you can provide a clearer, unredacted image or more context, I may be able to offer a more comprehensive explanation.
