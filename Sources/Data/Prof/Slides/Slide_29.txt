The slide presents information on the transition from extractive to abstractive question answering systems (Q&A) in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

On the left side, there is a diagram illustrating the traditional extractive Q&A process, which includes:

1. An Information Retrieval System: This is where external knowledge is queried, based on the input question, to find related context.
2. A Retriever: This component processes the input question and retrieves relevant contexts. It uses methods like BM25 or dense vector representations to rank the related contexts.
3. A Reader: Once the relevant contexts are ranked, the reader then selects a context and extracts the answer. The reader uses a reading comprehension model to determine the start and end tokens in the text to provide the answer.

On the right side, the slide shows the newer abstractive Q&A process, which adds an extra component:

1. An Information Retrieval System: Similar to the extractive process, it finds related content based on the input question.
2. A Retriever: It retrieves and ranks relevant contexts using methods like BM25 or dense vector representations.
3. A Generator: Instead of a reader that extracts an answer directly from the text, an abstractive system uses a generator to create an answer. The generator is based on language models (LM) such as BERT, GPT, etc., and generates an answer that is not constrained to the extracted text, thereby potentially providing more nuanced responses. 

Additionally, the slide includes a dialogue box on the right-hand side that seems to be discussing a subscription for a service related to these Q&A systems, differentiating pricing of extractive services at $20 from abstractive services, where a subscription fee offers additional benefits.

This diagram contrasts the two methods to show how the abstractive method can potentially generate more flexible and human-like answers as it's not limited to only providing excerpts from existing texts but can generate new text based on the information retrieved.
