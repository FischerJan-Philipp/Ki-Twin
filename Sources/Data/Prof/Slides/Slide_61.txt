The slide appears to be discussing the architecture of the Transformer model, specifically focusing on the "Add & Norm" or residual connections. Transformers are designed for handling sequential data, such as language for tasks like translation, and have become a fundamental component in modern natural language processing (NLP).

In the context of Transformers, the "Add & Norm" step refers to the residual connection followed by layer normalization, which is applied in both the encoder and decoder parts of the architecture. Here's the relevant information from the slide:

- The top part of the slide shows the Encoder part of the Transformer model. The input denoted by "X" from the previous encoder layer is sent into a "multi-headed Self-attention" block, which enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- After the self-attention block, the output "Z" is added to the original input "X" in the "Add and normalize" step, which is the residual connection. This means the output of the self-attention block is added to its input, to help in gradients flow during backpropagation, preventing the vanishing gradient problem, and allowing deeper networks.
- Subsequently, "Layer normalization" is performed to normalize the values in the network, to stabilize learning and allow for faster training.
- Following the addition and normalization step, the output is sent to a "Feed Forward" layer, which is typically a position-wise, fully connected feed-forward network applied to each position separately and identically. 
- The output of the feed-forward layer is again added to its input (the output of the previous add and normalize step) and then normalized, forming another residual connection followed by layer normalization.

The bottom part of the slide looks like a schematic representation of multiple repeated Encoder blocks, which comprise the full Encoder part of the Transformer. Each block consists of:

- A "multi-headed Self-attention" block, followed by "Add & Norm".
- A "Feed Forward" block, again followed by "Add & Norm".

Additionally, it can be noted that "Positional Encoding" is added to the input embeddings at the base of this stack to incorporate the order of the sequence, as the self-attention mechanism does not inherently capture sequence order.

The presence of multiple Encoder blocks stacked on top of each other (N x) allows the model to learn complex patterns in sequential data. Typically, the decoder would have a similar structure with some additional components to handle the output generation process, but this slide seems to focus only on the Encoder.
